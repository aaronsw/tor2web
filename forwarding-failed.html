<h1>Connection failed</h1>

<p>Sorry, we couldn't find the page you requested. This could be because:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p><strong>You entered an invalid URL.</strong> This is most likely if you get this page immediately after trying to visit a URL. This service only works with valid <code>.onion</code> URLs. Please check your URL and try again.</li>
  <li><p><strong>The server you're trying to connect to is down.</strong> This is most likely if you get this page after a long wait. Please try again later.</li>
  <li><p><strong>The Tor network is overloaded.</strong> This is most likely if you have other reasons to believe the URL is valid and the server is up. Please try again later.</li>
  <li><p><strong>There's a problem with tor2web.</strong> This is most likely if you get this error on every uncached request. Please let us know.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you need to get to the page urgently, you can also <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en">download the Tor browser bundle</a> and replace <code>.tor2web.org</code> with <code>.onion</code> to visit the web page directly through Tor.</p>
